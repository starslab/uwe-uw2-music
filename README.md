Authentic music packs for Underworld Exporter / Ultima Underworld 2

Underworld Exporter is a Unity environment capable of reading the original game data for Ultima Underworld, and running the game. It also works, to greater or lesser degrees, for other games based on the same engine, such as Ultima Underworld 2 and System Shock.

These files are music packs for Ultima Underworld 2, containing 5 authentic soundtrack reproductions:

OPL2/Adlib
DualOPL2/SoundBlaster Pro (1.0)
DualOPL2/SoundBlaster Pro (1.0) with post-processing effects
Roland MT-32
Roland MT-32 with enhanced reverb
I expect almost everyone will choose one of the Roland packs to play the game with, but all five are included for completeness.
